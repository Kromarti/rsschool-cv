## About Myself

My name is Vitaly. I am 24 years old and I am from Molodechno, Minsk region. My city is small but very cozy and quiet. This is a good city for starting a family. However, it is not suitable for a young and ambitious person who wants to take everything from life.

I have a higher education. I work as an engineer in the energy sector. But I want to try something new. I have military ticket and not a subject to any form of military service.

My strengths are perseverance, the desire to constantly learn, full immersion in the task, the desire to be the best.

I am interested in programming language C. I liked this feeling of delight when the program was working. I want even more of this euphoria.

My objectives are to take everything from this course, go through it to the end and get your first job as a Frontend Developer.

## Skills

Hyper text markup language (HTML), Cascading style sheets (CSS), basic knowledge of Git, JavaScript and C.  

## Example of code:

```javascript
        function getPrimeNumber(n) {
            again: for (i = 2; i<n; i++) {
                for (j = 2; j<i; j++) {
                    if (i % j == 0) continue again;
                }
                alert(i);
            }
        }
```

## Trainings

## Education
